# tasting_bot

This is the first pass attempt at applying a Markov Chain text bot to generate wine tasting notes. Output can be found on @SOMMarkov on twitter (twitter.com/SOMMarkov)

## Potential Expansions
* Prettier/more efficient code
* More sophisticated seeding 
* Given a Price and Style output a seeded random note
* Recieve @s and reply with seeded notes
* Scrap more sources of notes for better training set

Base dataset scraped from Wine Spectator review notes
Twitter integration based heavily on https://github.com/srome/markovbot
